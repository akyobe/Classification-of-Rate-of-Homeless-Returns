# Classification and Prediction of Rates of Return to Homelessness in Travis County

## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing the rates of return to homelessness in Travis County from 2017 to 2021. Using data from the Continuum of Care, we examine various demographic factors to understand their impact on homelessness recurrence.

## Objectives
- To explore demographic patterns influencing the likelihood of returning to homelessness.
- To predict the rate of return to homelessness using statistical models.

## Technologies Used
- R
- ggplot2, dplyr, tidyverse, plotROC, caret, rpart, rpart.plot

## Data
This project uses data from the [City of Austin's open data portal](https://data.austintexas.gov). Specifically, it focuses on the rates of return to homelessness in Travis County from 2017 to 2021.

### Dataset
The dataset can be accessed directly from the following link: [Strategic Measure_Number of returns to homelessness](https://data.austintexas.gov/Health-and-Community-Services/Strategic-Measure_Number-of-returns-to-homelessnes/jy3f-9rpf).

## Acknowledgements
We extend our thanks to the City of Austin and the individuals involved in the open data that we utilized in this exploratory project. To our professor, Dr. Guyot, we appreciate your organizing this collaboration as well as your assistance during the data cleaning. Through this exploratory data analysis, we have learned to better organize our R code in a manner that would be easy to understand for someone who didn't write the code. In addition, we have also learned the value of feedback from teammates to create the best and most concise end result. After this project, we are eager to wrangle and analyze more real-world data sets.**
