# Classification-of-Rate-of-Homeless-Returns
This project explores and analyzes the rates at which individuals return to homelessness in Travis County, focusing on data from 2017 to 2021. Utilizing the Continuum of Care (CoC) data sets, we delve into various demographic factors, such as race, disability, veteran status, and the impact of different types of prior housing on homelessness recurrence.

Key components of our analysis include:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigating demographic patterns and their influence on the likelihood of returning to homelessness.

Statistical Models: Implementing linear and logistic regression models, and decision trees to predict the rate of return to homelessness.

Cross-Validation: Employing five-fold cross-validation for model accuracy and reliability.

Ethical Considerations: Addressing disparities and inconsistencies in data, especially concerning demographic representation.

Our work aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of CoC interventions and to identify critical demographic factors influencing homelessness recurrence. This project not only contributes to urban planning and social welfare discussions but also serves as a call to action for improving support systems for vulnerable populations in Austin.
