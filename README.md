# Classification and Prediction of Rates of Return to Homelessness in Travis County

## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing the rates of return to homelessness in Travis County from 2017 to 2021. Using data from the Continuum of Care, we examine various demographic factors to understand their impact on homelessness recurrence.

## Objectives
- To explore demographic patterns influencing the likelihood of returning to homelessness.
- To predict the rate of return to homelessness using statistical models.

## Technologies Used
- R
- ggplot2, dplyr, tidyverse, plotROC, caret, rpart, rpart.plot
